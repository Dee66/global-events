# Processing Module

This module provides services for event normalization and enrichment.
- **NormalizationService**: Standardizes and validates incoming event data.
- **EnrichmentService**: Adds additional metadata or context to events (e.g., geo-tagging, deduplication).

Extend these services to implement your business logic for event processing before storage or notification.
