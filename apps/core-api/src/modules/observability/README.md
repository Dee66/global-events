# Observability Module

This module provides logging, metrics, and correlation ID middleware for system observability.
- **LoggerService**: Structured logging (extend as needed)
- **MetricsService**: Prometheus-compatible metrics (extend as needed)
- **CorrelationIdMiddleware**: Adds a correlation ID to each request for tracing

Integrate these services and middleware for robust monitoring and debugging.
