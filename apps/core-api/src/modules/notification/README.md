# Notification Module

This module provides strategy-based notification channels for real-time and asynchronous delivery:
- **WebSocket** for real-time browser/app notifications
- **Email** for SMTP-based delivery
- **Push** for mobile push notifications (e.g., Firebase)

Extend these services to implement actual channel logic and integrate with user subscriptions and event triggers.
